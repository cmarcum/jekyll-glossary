# jekyll-glossary
A template for creating glossaries using jekyll on github pages

# Summary
The template includes a default layout that uses liquid to pull in glossary terms stored as individual markdown files in [_terms/](_terms/). The script in glossary.md sorts the glossary alphanumerically, which is used by index.html.
